# strain2bfunc

## Motivations
The strain-resolved analysis is a widespread demand because the co-existence of strains with distinct functional capacities in the microbial communities indicates unique functional/metabolic capability
* Microbiome association studies: more host phenotypes can be distinguished, which can NOT be achieved at the species level or higher taxonomic ranks
* Strain-specific infection: Help physicians make accurate clinical diagnoses, relevant to bacterial resistance to infection
* Explore the transmission/translocation patterns of strain-specific microorganisms

## Key challenges
* The conventional metagenome method requires high sequencing coverage and is thus cost-prohibitive and resource-intensive.
* Low-biomass issues make strain-level microbial identification harder<img width="780" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shihuang047/strain2bfunc/assets/44211414/9c517599-872d-49d7-a303-b3cc4cb11745">


## Installation
--------------------------------
### System requirements
#### Dependencies
All scripts in strain2bfunc are written using R and C++, recommended to run in a conda environment. This program should work properly in the Unix systems, or Mac OSX, as all required packages can be appropriately downloaded and installed.

#### Disk space
Construction of a strain2bfunc standard database (i.e., 2bstrain-DB) requires approximately 10 GB of disk space.

#### Memory usage
Running the standard pipeline requires < 30Gb of RAM, which is also compatible with multithreading. For example, the BcgI-derived (default) database size is 9.32 GB, and you will need more than that in RAM if you want to build the default database. In a test early on, the peak memory can reach up to 29GB.

#### Speed
About 20 minutes are required for loading the 2bstrain-DB. For a typical gut metagenome, ~40 minutes are required for species profiling.

### Download the pipeline

Clone the latest version from GitHub (recommended):  

   `git clone https://github.com/shihuang047/strain2bfunc/`  
   `cd strain2bfunc`

### Construct the reference strain2bfunc database (required)

The script `tools/Download_2bstrain-DB.sh` in this repo can be used to:
   
   * Download the prebuilt 2bstrain-DB from Figshare based on the GTDB  
   * Download the example datasets for the pipeline tutorial

### Overview

### Usage

#### Estimate the species abundance using our 2bRAD-M. 

Please refer to more details in our past Github repo: `https://github.com/shihuang047/2bRAD-M`. 

#### Predict the strain-level abundance for a set of selective abundant species. 

The main script for implementing those analyses is `Rscript Scripts/strain2b/strain_pipeline.R` in this repo. You can check out the usage by printing the help information via `Rscript Scripts/strain2b/strain_pipeline.R -h`.

DESCRIPTION
We here provided a streamlined `strain2bfunc` pipeline for analyzing strain microbial compositions from the 2bRAD/shotgun metagenomics data based on the 2bRAD copy-number matrix.
USAGE

USAGE
Rscript Scripts/strain2b/strain_pipeline.R

PARAMETERS
-m <int> MODE, choices=c(0, 1), 0 for global strain level profiling, 1 for strain level profiling for identified species [default 0]
-l <file> The filepath of the sample list. Each line includes an input sample ID and the file path of corresponding DNA sequence data where each field should be separated by <tab>.
-a <file> The species abundance file [Required when MODE is equal to 0].
-t <int> The threshold of species abundance for strain-level identification [Required when MODE is equal to 0, default 0.001].
-s <file> The identified species list [Required when MODE is equal to 1].
-o <file> Output directory [default is ., it means the current directory].
-h Show this help message and exit.
```

#### Functional prediction based on strain-level abundance profiles. 
DESCRIPTION

We developed a C++ tool to compute the KO abundance table based on the strain composition abundance table. 

USAGE

[Input options, required]
 -i Input species abundance file
 -m Input map file of species and kos
[Output options]
 -o Output kos abundance file, default is "ko.abd"
[Other options]
 -h Help
```
